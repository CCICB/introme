Please ensure that the .toml files are updated to ensure the path of the annotation files used is correct.

In addition to these annotation files, please download the appopriate genome build annotations to this folder:
GENCODE GTF
CADD V1.3-1.5 (NOT V1.6)
SPIDEX V1.1
dbscSNV

To allow for allele frequency annotation and filtering, download an annotation file (e.g. gnomAD) to this folder.
